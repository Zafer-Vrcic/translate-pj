<h3>Technologies Used </h3> 
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
Redux Toolkit: A powerful toolset for efficient Redux development, which simplifies the process of managing application state.
React-Select: A flexible and beautiful Select Input control for React, used for language selection.
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, utilized for making API requests.
Form Data: Used for creating form data objects to send in requests.

 <h3>Redux Toolkit and Thunk </h3>
Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides a set of tools to simplify the store setup, create slices, and handle reducers, making state management more straightforward and efficient.
Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. This function can perform asynchronous dispatching of actions, enabling you to handle complex logic, such as API calls, directly in your action creators.
